# Project: CSS Variables

## About
I've been doing some form of web development for about seven years or so... mostly basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've taken two of [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) nanodegree programs: Front End and Full Stack Web Developer. I have learned a lot from those courses but I know that there are situations and use cases that I haven't seen or been exposed to.

I recently heard about Wes Bos and also his 30 Day JavaScript challenge. It's a free course (at least during the writing of this) and it can be found here: [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

This project is a practice in writing vanilla JavaScript and to learn about other use cases.

* Create custom html attributes using `data-*`, ie. `data-sizing`
* Access attribute with JavaScript using `this.dataset.*`, ie. `this.dataset.sizing`
* Use `document.documentElement.style.setProperty` to change value of CSS variable
